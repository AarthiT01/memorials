I've had the pleasure and honor on working with Shuli in growing the LF Energy Foundation over the past few years. Shuli was always passionate towards her vision of open source being the solution to the climate challenge in front of our society. But it was more than just professional passion; her passionate was personally drove her, and up to her last days she was constantly pushing forward towards that vision. Her relentless drive is the reason LF Energy has gotten to the level of success it has achieved and is well setup for the future.

I only met Shuli one time in person, and this was at an LF offsite after we had been working together for quite some time. I remember it fondly because during that conversation, I recieved a phone call that my brother had died. Shuli immediately consoled me, showing sympathy and support, and checking in on me regularly in the weeks that followed to make sure I'm ok. Another time, after a series of summer storms that knocked power out for my home for several days, she sent me an emergency lantern and power pack. She would start many of our conversations while she was battling cancer with "How are you doing John? Are you doing ok with all of this?" This is the side of Shuli I truly admire - that she was not just a great visionary, but a human that truly loved and cared about the people around her.

I'll miss Shuli immensely, from the long and winding conversations we would have, us sharing stories of our lives and families, and us working through the various challenges faced while I supported her in growing LF Energy. My biggest sadness for her leaving this world too soon is that for all the hard work she put into this foundation, that she won't be here in person to see it all come together. However, I do know that she will be with us all and this foundation in spirit as it grows to new heights.
